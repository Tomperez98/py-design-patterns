# Pattern Name: [Decorator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCraGHx6gso)

## How it works

**Decorator** is a structural pattern that allows adding new behavior to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects, called *decorators*

using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since **both target objects and decorators follow the same interface**. The resulting object will get a stacking behavior of all wrappers
